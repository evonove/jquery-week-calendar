====================
jQuery-week-calendar
====================

This is an old plugin which is strictly bound to jQuery and jQuery UI.
Because ECMAScript 6 is coming, jQuery will probably be replaced by native programming 
(at the moment `ECMAScript 5 is sufficient`_ to remove all common functions) or by
advanced frontend frameworks like `AngularJS`_ or `EmberJS`_.

For all these reasons, we decided to stop working on this project, which was used in one of our
product (`Timely`_), and start a new fresh and modern project: `planner.js`_

Check out this new project already available on `bower.io`_ and with an advanced plugin system!
